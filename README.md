## General Info:
This project is designed to function as a student and faculty member class registration system. It is designed such that there is a registrar to control the database containing the information of student, faculty, and courses. When logged in as the registrar, using the correct username and password, the registrar can add, change, or remove information that is stored in the database. Student's and faculty are able to login to their own system where they can add/remove classes to their schedule, reset their entire schedule, or save their schedule. 
## Technologies:
